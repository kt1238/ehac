<h3>Crack the hashes!</h3>
<ul>
  <li>In this exercise we try a scenario in which we have a managed to gain access to a database and download the usernames and password! The passwords however are hashed. How will we gain access to them?</li>
  <li>
    Feel free to make use of any suitable tools for cracking the password hashes, the format of the file is "Username":"hashed password"
  </li>
  <li>John knows a lot about this kind of thing try asking him for help (access your kali VM and type "john" to see options) </li>
  <li>The FLAG is the first letter of every password you crack put together! </li>
  <li> E.g if the cracked passwords are the following 
  	 <ul>
  	 	<li>password</li>
  	 	<li>thomas</li>
  	 	<li>qwerty</li>
  	 	<li>security</li>
  	 </ul>	
  </li>
  <li> The flag will be "flag{ptqs}"</li>
</ul>
