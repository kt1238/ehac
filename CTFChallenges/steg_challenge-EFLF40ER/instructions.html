Dear [omitted],

<br/><br/>
I hope this email finds you well!
I wanted to share this beautiful image with you - it's quite the piece of art, if I do say so myself.
Take a moment to admire it!

<br/><br/>
To better appreciate its art, please consider my comments and critique.
I would say that its main subject can be thought in two parts.
A deep look at the first part can discover a secret meaning that can only be unravelled by the contemplation of the second part.
The second part hides a layer, the key to understand the secret I mentioned above.

<br/><br/>
Sincerely,
<br/>

P.S.: Totally unrelated, I think the best encryption is AES-256-CBC and generally like using salted keys with pass phrases.
