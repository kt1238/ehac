<h2>Challenge Description</h2>

Web applications often keep user data in server-side and, increasingly,
client-side databases and later display it to users. No matter where
such user-controlled data comes from, it should be handled carefully.
<br><br>
This level shows how easily XSS bugs can be introduced in complex apps.

<h2>Challenge Objective</h2>

Inject a script to pop up an <code>alert()</code> in the context of the
application.  
<br><br>
<b>Note</b>: the application saves your posts so if you sneak
in code to execute the alert, this level will be solved
every time you reload it.
