<h2>Challenge Description</h2>

As you've seen in the previous level, some common JS functions 
are <i>execution sinks</i> which means that they will cause the
browser to execute any scripts that appear in their input. 
Sometimes this fact is hidden by higher-level APIs which 
use one of these functions under the hood.
<br><br>
The application on this level is using one such hidden sink.

<h2>Challenge Objective</h2>

As before, inject a script to pop up a JavaScript <code>alert()</code> in
the app.
<br><br>
Since you can't enter your payload anywhere in the application,
you will have to manually edit the address in the URL bar below.
