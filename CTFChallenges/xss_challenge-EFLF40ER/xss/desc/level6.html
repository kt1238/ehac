<h2>Challenge Description</h2>

Complex web applications sometimes have the capability to dynamically load
JavaScript libraries based on the value of their URL
parameters or part of <code>location.hash</code>. 
<br><br>
This is very tricky to get right -- allowing user input to influence the URL
when loading scripts or other potentially dangerous types of data such as
<code>XMLHttpRequest</code> often leads to serious vulnerabilities.

<h2>Challenge Objective</h2>

Find a way to <u>make the application request an external file</u> which will cause it to execute an <code>alert()</code>.
