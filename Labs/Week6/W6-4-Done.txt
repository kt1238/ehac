Task 1:
passwd file contains rows of
- User Name
- Encrypted Password (stored in /etc/shadow)
- User ID number
- User Group ID number
- Full Name of User (GECOS)
- User Home Directory
- Default Shell

Task 2:
If a webpage is loading a file from the server using a command like
?filename = "rsc/images/demo.png"
An adversary could modify the url like so
?filename = "../../../etc/passwd"
and then has access the passwd file

This can be prevented by sanitizing user input, starting from a base directory, and throwing errors if we do not load from this base directory

Task 3:
?
