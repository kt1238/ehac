<h3>Encryption and Decryption of files with insecure code </h3>
<ul>
  <li>In this excercise we try a scenario in which we have the code used to encrypt and decrypt the file known to us</li>
  <li>We want to leverage this vulnerability and change the file so that we can use it to decrypt without knowing the password</li>
  <li>
    The program runs as follows:
    <ul> 
      <li>Inspect the jar file, what is it?</li>
      <li>Do a little reverse engineering...</li>
      <li>... and finally run : java -jar EncDenc.jar -d "filename" "password" to decrypt!</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
