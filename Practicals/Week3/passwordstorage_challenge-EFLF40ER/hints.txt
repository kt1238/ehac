the password hash is 40 bits so it is SHA 1
(MD5 = 32 chars, SHA 256 = 64)

The program takes our password input, hashes it and then compares it with the hash stored in password.txt
if we delete password.txt there is a zsh: segmentation fault

Solution 1
Hash lots of passwords till we find a matching one

Solution 2
Modify the password stored to match ours
