<h3>Encryption and Decryption of files with secure code but insecure password storage</h3>
<ul>
  <li>In this excercise we try a scenario in which we have a blackbox encryption/decryption function but have access to how the password is stored</li>
  <li>
    The program runs as follows: ./EncDenc -d/-e "filename" "password"
  </li>
  <li>You have a hard way if you wanted to modify the file, the easiest thing is to modify is the password.. but how?</li>
</ul>
